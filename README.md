# Precious Metal Prices Dashboard

This web application is a customized project based on the LinkedIn Learning course on "Data Visualization in Python with Dash." It employs Dash and Plotly to visualize precious metal prices between 2018 and 2021.

## Compatibility Notes

The original code for this project was developed in PyCharm using Dash and Plotly (app.py). To make the project compatible with Streamlit, a new file, the_app.py, was created. Below are key changes made for compatibility:

- Replaced Dash components with Streamlit components.
- Updated callback functions to adhere to Streamlit's syntax and structure.
